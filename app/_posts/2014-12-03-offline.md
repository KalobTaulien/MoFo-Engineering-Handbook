# Offline

What is an offline web application? How can you download when you're offline? Web pages are things you download and render. Downloading implies a network connection. Of course you can't download when you're offline, but you can download when you're online and that's how HTML5 web applications work.

## appcache

There are multiple ways to create offline web applications and one of those is appcache. HTML5 provides an application caching mechanism that lets web-based applications run offline. Application Cache (AppCache) interface to specify resources that the browser should cache and make available to offline users. Applications that are cached load and work correctly even if users click the refresh button when they are offline.

Using an application cache gives an application the following benefits:

* Offline browsing: users can navigate a site even when they are offline.
* Speed: cached resources are local, and therefore load faster.
* Reduced server load: the browser only downloads resources that have changed from the server.

### manifest file
With application cache it is easy to make an offline version of a web application, by creating a cache manifest file.

#### Structure of a manifest file

```
CACHE MANIFEST
index.html
stylesheet.css
images/logo.png
scripts/main.js
http://cdn.example.com/scripts/main.js
```

#### Enabling the application cache

```
<html manifest="example.appcache">
  ...
</html>
```
