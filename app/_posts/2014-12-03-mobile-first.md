## Process
As much of our future audience may have only experienced the web through their
mobile devices, anything user-facing should be mobile from the first speck of
an idea onward. This means getting stakeholders and designers on board with a
mobile-first attitude, so we don’t end up with desktop content just squished
down into a mobile box.

## Styles
- use responsive fonts for increased readability
- style from small to large viewports using `@media (min-width: …`
- use css instead of images whenever possible

## Assets
- reduce http requests
- use fewer libraries
- concatenate & minify scripts and styles
- use image sprites
- use svg instead of jpg/gif/png when appropriate
- use a tool like imagemin to compress image files
